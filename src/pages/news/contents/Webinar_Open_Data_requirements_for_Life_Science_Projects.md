This webinar on the 31th of January (13.00 CET) from [ELIXIR Norway](https://elixir.no) will provide you with information on Open Data and Data Management requirements for research applications to the Research Council of Norway (RCN) call for proposals with deadline February 8th.

For projects funded by RCN [open science is now one of the assessment criteria](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/processing-grant-applications/processing-applications/assessment-open-science) and all funded projects must assess the need for a Data Management Plan. In this webinar we will highlight the RCN requirements for Open Data and Data Management from a Life Science perspective and provide a short introduction to the Data Management Planning tool "Data Stewardship Wizard" by ELIXIR Norway.

This 45 minutes webinar will be presented by Korbinian Bösl (ELIXIR Norway, BioMedData & Centre for Digital Life Norway)

Please register for the event on Zoom.
